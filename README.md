# first-neuron-network
The main goal was to create a simple neural network without the use of special libraries of Python. In this way it would be easier to understand the machine learning and how it works. 
The following network structure is needed to solve this problem:

-two inputs (x1 and x2) one output (y),

-two layers (two neurons in the first and one in the second) with full connections,

-unipolar sigmoid activation function for each neuron (f),

-bias for each neuron.
